#100 Days of Code Challenge
Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Challenge repository! Here, I'll be documenting my journey as I tackle daily coding challenges focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for the next 100 days.

##Introduction
This repository is a record of my commitment to improving my coding skills, particularly in the realm of DSA. Through this challenge, I aim to strengthen my problem-solving abilities, enhance my understanding of fundamental algorithms, and cultivate a consistent coding habit.

##Progress
Day 1-5:

###🌟 Accomplishment:
Mastered the fundamentals of Arrays! From understanding the basics to solving intricate problems, it's been a day full of revelations.

###🧠 Highlights: 
📌 Deep dive into array theory 📖
📌 Extensive practice with real-world problems 🚀
📌 Overcoming challenges and learning from mistakes 💪
               
###💡 Key Takeaway: The beauty of arrays lies not just in their simplicity but in their versatility. Excited to implement this knowledge in future projects! 💼🌐
Note: This README will be regularly updated to reflect my progress throughout the 100 days.

###Folder Structure:
/Day1: Contains code and notes for Day 1 of the challenge.
/Day2: Contains code and notes for Day 2 of the challenge.
/Day3: Contains code and notes for Day 3 of the challenge.
/Day4: Contains code and notes for Day 4 of the challenge.
/Day5: Contains code and notes for Day 5 of the challenge.
Add folders for subsequent days as you progress through the challenge.

##Goals:
By the end of the 100 days, I aim to achieve the following:

• Mastery of fundamental data structures and algorithms. 📚
• Improved problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking. 💡
• Completion of at least one coding challenge daily. ⏰
• Consistent contribution to open-source repositories. 🛠️

##Support:
Your support and encouragement mean a lot to me! Feel free to leave comments, suggestions, or words of motivation on the individual day's code submissions. Let's learn and grow together through this journey! 🌱

##Happy coding! 🚀
