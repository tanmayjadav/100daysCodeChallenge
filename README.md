# 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Challenge repository! Here, I'll be documenting my journey as I tackle daily coding challenges focusing on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for the next 100 days.

## Introduction

This repository is a record of my commitment to improving my coding skills, particularly in the realm of DSA. Through this challenge, I aim to strengthen my problem-solving abilities, enhance my understanding of fundamental algorithms, and cultivate a consistent coding habit.


## Progress

### Day 1-40:

### 🌟 Accomplishment: <br>
Mastered the fundamentals of Arrays! From understanding the basics to solving intricate problems, it's been a day full of revelations.

### 🧠 Highlights: 

📌 Deep dive into array theory 📖 <br>
📌 Extensive practice with real-world problems 🚀 <br>
📌 Overcoming challenges and learning from mistakes 💪 <br>
               
### 💡 Key Takeaway: 
The beauty of arrays lies not just in their simplicity but in their versatility. Excited to implement this knowledge in future projects! 💼🌐
Note: This README will be regularly updated to reflect my progress throughout the 100 days.
